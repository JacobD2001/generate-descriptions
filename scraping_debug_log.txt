LAB TESTS WITH HYDROGENNEW ! EMISSION TESTS ACC ISO 15848Solid Metal SealsWeld ring gasketsTechnical Video3D ModelTechnical DataSketchDescriptionSPETORING®RM 1SPETORING®RM 1is a basic solution for application where the space between flanges is limited. Widely met as per DIN 2695 standard 4mm thick rings. Easiest solution either concerning material consumption and manufacturing cost.Inside weld seams are the only available option (errors on inside joint welding are difficult to repair). Any customised dimensions also available. Rewelding: can be re-welded up to 5 times, material loss ~3mm each.Radial compensation up to 0.3mm.SPETORING®RM 2This solution is technically based on idea similar to what is in RM 1 case but both outside weld seams/ inside weld seams option is available which facilitate installation.Customised construction ofSPETORING®RM 2are available – starting from this profile all profiles with outside weld seam can be deliver with partitions. Rewelding up to 5times (3mm each loss).Please not the radial compensation is only like 0.1mm.SPETORING®RM 3First of hollow lip weld-ring seals solution. It performs more thermal and pressure shock resistance compare to RM 1 and RM 2. But the ‘membrane’ effect is yet not that visible as the hollow lip small dimensions. Customize cross-sections and partitions available.Outside weld seams available but as all this construction is strongly determined by existing limitations (not enough space between flanges for RM 5 and existing redial movements of the joint deserving the hollow-lip solution) the access to outside seam is difficult, which effect request of high performance in welding process.TheSPETORING®RM 3is Weld Ring Seal is possible to be installed for application with bars (partitions).However re-welding is possible approx. 2-3times. Radial compensation up to 0.5mm.SPETORING®RM 4Full size hollow lip weld-ring gasket (inside weld seam only available to flanges). Advanced construction recommended especially for large diameter joints.SPETORING®RM 4is capable to compensate great axial and radial differential expansions; extremely resistant to thermal and pressure shocks.The inside weld seam sometimes is a great advantage as prevent from crevice corrosion in compare to outside seam solution. If crevice corrosion is an important issue – than auxiliary inside seal should also be used.Typical thickness is 2x15mm (30mm for full seal). Customised crosssection and diameters are available (which allows to install this adopted/ customized weld ring seal using existing flanges with shapes ready for other types of seals: spigot recess, delta shape, double cone, etc...).Rewelding up to 4times (easy to dismantle with 2mm cut-off disc). Radial compensation up to 5.0mm.SPETORING®RM 5Full size hollow lip weld-ring gasket (outside weld seam possible). Most advanced construction recommended especially for large flanges and joints equipped in any partitions requested !Capable to compensate great an axial and radial differential expansions; extremely resistant to thermal and pressure shocks.InSPETORING®RM 5customised cross-section and diameters are available (which allows to install this adopted/ customized weld ring seal using existing flanges with shapes ready for other types of seals: spigot recess, delta shape, double cone, etc...). This Weld Ring Seal is possible to be installed for application with bars (partitions).Rewelding up to 4times (easy to dismantle with 2mm cut-off disc) can be re-welded 2 to 4 times.Radial compensation up to 5.0mm.SPETORING®RM 6Full size hollow lip weld-ring gasket (inside weld seam only available to flanges). Special construction recommended especially for joints which cannot be spreaded to allow installation of typical R-M 4 seal. Similar to above R-M 4 and R-M 5 modelsSPETORING®R-M 6is capable to compensate axial and radial differential expansions, also being extremely resistant to thermal and pressure shocks.Typical thickness is 2x15mm (30mm for full seal). However because of special contruction ofSPETORING®R-M 6flanges need only to be speeded about 10mm away (instead of 30mm at standard R-M 4 solution). All the other parameter as in R-M 4 case.SPETORING®RM 2 / ConvexAuxiliary weld-ring gasketin different styles: – installed either in groove closed from 4sides (Dryflex, Convex, Kammprofile, Spiral Wound, o-ring); – installed in groove closed from 3sides (Dryflex, Convex, Kammprofile, o-ring); – sealing profile (Dryflex, Convex, Kammprofile) machined on the weld ring surface.The following function ofauxiliary gasket: – preventing crevice corrosion (inside weld seam solutions case); – hydraulic pressure test performed using this spare gasket, than final welding or repeat dismantling option; – auxiliary gasket is used as reliable primary operational seal and the weld ring additional prevention seal if the primary one will fail.SPETORING®R-M 4 / DryflexSPETORING®R-M 4 / R-M 4 SPECIALMany other customized solutions of Weld Rings are available on request. Spetech can provideWeld Ringsdedicated to existing geometry of flanges (tongue – groove, male – female, flat-groove, others). This mean no need of hard modifications of existing flanges is required.Another special solution is installation of Weld Rings set instead pair of 2 flat gaskets divided by Tube Sheet. Flat gaskets in such type of applications are especially trouble making, because 1 set of long bolts is responsible to secure tightness (and generate necessary surface stress) of 2 flat gaskets. Many other customized solutions ofWeld Ringswhich fit to specific customers need are available on request.Spetech® 360˚Spetech® Laminated Triple Offset Butterfly Valve SealSpetech® Weld Ring GasketSpetech® Double Cone SealSpetech® Dryflex® Super Flexible KammprofileSpetech® Carrier RingSpetech General PresentationSpetech® 360˚Spetech® Laminated Triple Offset Butterfly Valve SealSpetech® Weld Ring GasketSpetech® Double Cone SealSpetech® Dryflex® Super Flexible KammprofileSpetech® Carrier RingSpetech General Presentation

Widely met as per DIN 2695 standard 4mm thick rings. Easiest solution either concerning material consumption and manufacturing cost.Inside weld seams are the only available option (errors on inside joint welding are difficult to repair). Any customised dimensions also available. Rewelding: can be re-welded up to 5 times, material loss ~3mm each.Radial compensation up to 0.3mm.SPETORING®RM 2This solution is technically based on idea similar to what is in RM 1 case but both outside weld seams/ inside weld seams option is available which facilitate installation.Customised construction ofSPETORING®RM 2are available – starting from this profile all profiles with outside weld seam can be deliver with partitions. Rewelding up to 5times (3mm each loss).Please not the radial compensation is only like 0.1mm.SPETORING®RM 3First of hollow lip weld-ring seals solution. It performs more thermal and pressure shock resistance compare to RM 1 and RM 2. But the ‘membrane’ effect is yet not that visible as the hollow lip small dimensions. Customize cross-sections and partitions available.Outside weld seams available but as all this construction is strongly determined by existing limitations (not enough space between flanges for RM 5 and existing redial movements of the joint deserving the hollow-lip solution) the access to outside seam is difficult, which effect request of high performance in welding process.TheSPETORING®RM 3is Weld Ring Seal is possible to be installed for application with bars (partitions).However re-welding is possible approx. 2-3times. Radial compensation up to 0.5mm.SPETORING®RM 4Full size hollow lip weld-ring gasket (inside weld seam only available to flanges). Advanced construction recommended especially for large diameter joints.SPETORING®RM 4is capable to compensate great axial and radial differential expansions; extremely resistant to thermal and pressure shocks.The inside weld seam sometimes is a great advantage as prevent from crevice corrosion in compare to outside seam solution. If crevice corrosion is an important issue – than auxiliary inside seal should also be used.Typical thickness is 2x15mm (30mm for full seal). Customised crosssection and diameters are available (which allows to install this adopted/ customized weld ring seal using existing flanges with shapes ready for other types of seals: spigot recess, delta shape, double cone, etc...).Rewelding up to 4times (easy to dismantle with 2mm cut-off disc). Radial compensation up to 5.0mm.SPETORING®RM 5Full size hollow lip weld-ring gasket (outside weld seam possible).

Through all this time we’ve been collecting experience and supplying our products to 100 countries around the World. We believe that high quality products can only be manufactured with highest care taken during whole process of production. That is why our manufacturing centre is situated in Poland. European standards and regulations ensure the quality and readiness of our high duty applications. ….moreOur Special Seals program includes most sophisticated profiles like: Weld Ring Gaskets, Lip Seals, Metal Diaphragms, Baffle Seals, Double Cones, Lens Gaskets, 3offset Seals and many others.Typically these sealings secure tightness of various types Pressure Vessels: Heat Exchangers, Reactors, Air Coolers, Tanks, Towers, Valves and similar The experience which we collected means we are capable of managing any serious sealing challenge which one can face: High Pressure, Cryogenic Environment, High Temperature, Corrosion, Vibrations, Axial or Lateral Flange Movements.All such bespoke sealings are our specialty – so next time if you seek a gasket made from special alloy, a seal to be supplied with special approvals, packing delivered in a short time or you simply need any other high duty sealing solution - check out our production program and send us an enquiry about your requirements.lessProductionEngineeringLaboratoryDownloadQualityAbout usSPETECHhas been established in 1988. From the beginning,SPETECHhas been providing both, technology and materials for operational support systems and maintenance. We specialise in process seals technology as well as other areas, to include lab testing and research, provision of technical advice in cooperation with national network of technical bodies, staff training, specialised services related to flange treatment, provision of software for measuring flange connections, production, delivery of seals as well as optimising the sealing systems for our customers.Laboratory of Sealing Materials (LSM) is being run in line with the EN ISO/IEC 17025 rules. The LSM runs gaskets tests in accordance with the EN 13555, ASTM F-586, F-36, F38, VDI 2440, EN 61340-2-3 standards; and armature packages testing in line with the EN ISO 15848-1. In addition to that, the LSM runs the tightness and mechanical properties tests according in compliance with internal procedures. The LSM is an approved sub-contractor for TÜV Rheinland and Polish Office of Technical Inspection (UDT).SPETECHprovides technical advice in the field of the diagnostics of gaping causes, based on the measurement of connections shape and dimensions, material analysis, chemical resistance, operation history as well as aging and corrosion processes analysis.The Flange Assembly and Bolting Training, in addition to an ongoing education in the area of modern sealing techniques, is being designed and delivered in compliance with EN-1591-4 and on two levels, i.e. for flange fitters and for the responsible engineers. The flange services are related to roughness determination, as well as shape declination measurement, predominantly, the flatness and conicity; and less often the cylindricity of sealed areas. In cases of shape aberrance, the mending and tooling processes (legalisation, turning, etc.) are put in place. The calculation program EUROPARTNER®being currently supplied, includes an algorithm compliant with the EN 1591-1:2013,- 2009, - 2001, ASME Code s. VIII, AD 2000 Merkblatt, WUDT. The soft database contains the seals, bolts, gaskets and flangestype and dimensions data as well as the material data related to all elements of the joints. Based on our analytical software and on the FEM method, we are determining the flange connections design features for particularly responsible connectors.The production is based on CNC and devices which guarantee highly repetitive and economical production. We have been ISO 9001 certified in this field for nearly 20 years. Our workshop areas currently span 5000 sq.m. We are compliant with EN ISO 3834-2 in the field of welded elements production.SPETECHproducts have numerous certificates and accreditations for their manufactured products, including from institutions such as: TÜV Rheinland, Polish Office of Technical Inspection (UDT), Münster University of Applied Sciences, Amtec, National Institute of Hygiene (PZH), and Oil and Gas Institute (INIG). We are a member of: European Sealing Association (ESA) and Polish Industrial Valves Association (SPAP).SPETECHis the first Eastern European company to become a member of the European Sealing Association (ESA) 1998, participating in the Flange Gasket Division and Packing Division activities. The ESA is a forum for the development and promotion of qualitative, safe and eco-friendly solutions in the area of seals. The Polish Industrial Valves Association plays a similar role in the Polish market andSPETECHare hoping to carry out similar activities through this association. Due to SPETECH’s specialisation in pressure equipment and being directly connected with the PED directive, we are working closely with a Polish supervisory authority, namely Polish Office of Technical Inspection (UDT), in the fields of pressure equipment manufacturing and testing. For the same reason, we are also working with other supervisory authorities from a wide range of countries, with jurisdiction both at European and national levels.As a result, we have been ISO 9001:2008 certified through the renowned and accredited TÜV Rheinland organisation since late 1990s.

About usSPETECHhas been established in 1988. From the beginning,SPETECHhas been providing both, technology and materials for operational support systems and maintenance. We specialise in process seals technology as well as other areas, to include lab testing and research, provision of technical advice in cooperation with national network of technical bodies, staff training, specialised services related to flange treatment, provision of software for measuring flange connections, production, delivery of seals as well as optimising the sealing systems for our customers.Laboratory of Sealing Materials (LSM) is being run in line with the EN ISO/IEC 17025 rules. The LSM runs gaskets tests in accordance with the EN 13555, ASTM F-586, F-36, F38, VDI 2440, EN 61340-2-3 standards; and armature packages testing in line with the EN ISO 15848-1. In addition to that, the LSM runs the tightness and mechanical properties tests according in compliance with internal procedures. The LSM is an approved sub-contractor for TÜV Rheinland and Polish Office of Technical Inspection (UDT).SPETECHprovides technical advice in the field of the diagnostics of gaping causes, based on the measurement of connections shape and dimensions, material analysis, chemical resistance, operation history as well as aging and corrosion processes analysis.The Flange Assembly and Bolting Training, in addition to an ongoing education in the area of modern sealing techniques, is being designed and delivered in compliance with EN-1591-4 and on two levels, i.e. for flange fitters and for the responsible engineers. The flange services are related to roughness determination, as well as shape declination measurement, predominantly, the flatness and conicity; and less often the cylindricity of sealed areas. In cases of shape aberrance, the mending and tooling processes (legalisation, turning, etc.) are put in place. The calculation program EUROPARTNER®being currently supplied, includes an algorithm compliant with the EN 1591-1:2013,- 2009, - 2001, ASME Code s. VIII, AD 2000 Merkblatt, WUDT. The soft database contains the seals, bolts, gaskets and flangestype and dimensions data as well as the material data related to all elements of the joints. Based on our analytical software and on the FEM method, we are determining the flange connections design features for particularly responsible connectors.The production is based on CNC and devices which guarantee highly repetitive and economical production. We have been ISO 9001 certified in this field for nearly 20 years. Our workshop areas currently span 5000 sq.m. We are compliant with EN ISO 3834-2 in the field of welded elements production.SPETECHproducts have numerous certificates and accreditations for their manufactured products, including from institutions such as: TÜV Rheinland, Polish Office of Technical Inspection (UDT), Münster University of Applied Sciences, Amtec, National Institute of Hygiene (PZH), and Oil and Gas Institute (INIG). We are a member of: European Sealing Association (ESA) and Polish Industrial Valves Association (SPAP).SPETECHis the first Eastern European company to become a member of the European Sealing Association (ESA) 1998, participating in the Flange Gasket Division and Packing Division activities. The ESA is a forum for the development and promotion of qualitative, safe and eco-friendly solutions in the area of seals. The Polish Industrial Valves Association plays a similar role in the Polish market andSPETECHare hoping to carry out similar activities through this association. Due to SPETECH’s specialisation in pressure equipment and being directly connected with the PED directive, we are working closely with a Polish supervisory authority, namely Polish Office of Technical Inspection (UDT), in the fields of pressure equipment manufacturing and testing. For the same reason, we are also working with other supervisory authorities from a wide range of countries, with jurisdiction both at European and national levels.As a result, we have been ISO 9001:2008 certified through the renowned and accredited TÜV Rheinland organisation since late 1990s.

The LSM runs gaskets tests in accordance with the EN 13555, ASTM F-586, F-36, F38, VDI 2440, EN 61340-2-3 standards; and armature packages testing in line with the EN ISO 15848-1. In addition to that, the LSM runs the tightness and mechanical properties tests according in compliance with internal procedures. The LSM is an approved sub-contractor for TÜV Rheinland and Polish Office of Technical Inspection (UDT).SPETECHprovides technical advice in the field of the diagnostics of gaping causes, based on the measurement of connections shape and dimensions, material analysis, chemical resistance, operation history as well as aging and corrosion processes analysis.The Flange Assembly and Bolting Training, in addition to an ongoing education in the area of modern sealing techniques, is being designed and delivered in compliance with EN-1591-4 and on two levels, i.e. for flange fitters and for the responsible engineers. The flange services are related to roughness determination, as well as shape declination measurement, predominantly, the flatness and conicity; and less often the cylindricity of sealed areas. In cases of shape aberrance, the mending and tooling processes (legalisation, turning, etc.) are put in place. The calculation program EUROPARTNER®being currently supplied, includes an algorithm compliant with the EN 1591-1:2013,- 2009, - 2001, ASME Code s. VIII, AD 2000 Merkblatt, WUDT. The soft database contains the seals, bolts, gaskets and flangestype and dimensions data as well as the material data related to all elements of the joints. Based on our analytical software and on the FEM method, we are determining the flange connections design features for particularly responsible connectors.The production is based on CNC and devices which guarantee highly repetitive and economical production. We have been ISO 9001 certified in this field for nearly 20 years. Our workshop areas currently span 5000 sq.m. We are compliant with EN ISO 3834-2 in the field of welded elements production.SPETECHproducts have numerous certificates and accreditations for their manufactured products, including from institutions such as: TÜV Rheinland, Polish Office of Technical Inspection (UDT), Münster University of Applied Sciences, Amtec, National Institute of Hygiene (PZH), and Oil and Gas Institute (INIG). We are a member of: European Sealing Association (ESA) and Polish Industrial Valves Association (SPAP).SPETECHis the first Eastern European company to become a member of the European Sealing Association (ESA) 1998, participating in the Flange Gasket Division and Packing Division activities. The ESA is a forum for the development and promotion of qualitative, safe and eco-friendly solutions in the area of seals. The Polish Industrial Valves Association plays a similar role in the Polish market andSPETECHare hoping to carry out similar activities through this association. Due to SPETECH’s specialisation in pressure equipment and being directly connected with the PED directive, we are working closely with a Polish supervisory authority, namely Polish Office of Technical Inspection (UDT), in the fields of pressure equipment manufacturing and testing. For the same reason, we are also working with other supervisory authorities from a wide range of countries, with jurisdiction both at European and national levels.As a result, we have been ISO 9001:2008 certified through the renowned and accredited TÜV Rheinland organisation since late 1990s. ISO 9001 is a certification required for pressure equipment deliveries. One of the examples of working in a local market, is our cooperation with a Belarusian organization, Gostpromnadzor.

The program contains several calculation algorithms compliant with:• EN 1591-1:2013• EN 1591-1:2009• EN 1591-1:2001• WUDT-UC-WO-/19:10.2003• ASME Code s. VIII• AD 2000 Merkblatt B7/B8• EN 13445-3 Annex GUsing the algorithm EN 1591-2009 or ...2013 the designer, by selection of appropriate tightness class, can inﬂuence reduction of emissions generated by the selected seal. Thus, the joint is designed in the way compliant with requirements of such environmental protection regulations as IPPC Directive, TA-Luft and Clean Air Act. Use of the EUROPARTNER®program as an engineering and expert tool constitutes a part of generally applied and recommended ”best available techniques” and “good engineering practices”.

Welcome to our Laboratory of Sealing Materials.We invite to test your Gaskets and Packings with us - you will be impressed by our Technical Competence and delighted by Customer Service provided.There are several facts that are making sealing materials more and more crucial within recent years. It is due to increasing importance of Fugitive Emissions reductions along with Environment Protection requirements becoming increasingly urgent. Moreover, it is as a consequence of growing expectations towards safety issues and worldwide striving to increase working lifetime and overall reliability of industrial equipment. All these facts are reasons which lead to make tests & researches & developments with goal to find an Optimum Sealing Solutions.‘Fugitive Emission’ regulations - formally expressed in acts like Clean Air Act, TA-Luft, IPPC, ISO 15848 – they furthermore include formal obligations for pressure vessels manufacturers and pressure installations users to install gaskets which will functionally secure their application acc. to ”Best Available Techniques” rules. Literally any newly build equipment, any installation already in operation must be designed, build and operated fulfilling appropriate emissions standards. To fulfil this requirement, gaskets and packings used as sealing components must be described by technical characteristics which proof their rightness.

But standard Weld Ring Gasket require about 30 to 50mm gap between spread flanges to be installed which sometimes might be an issue.A common question from people willing to put Weld Ring Seal is “can this 30 or 50mm spread be somehow reduced”, as sometimes large flange spread distance is not available.The answer is ‘YES, the spread can be reduced’ and the solution you can find on presented RM4 / RM5 / RM6 Weld Rings height and flange spread gap comparation.This particular SPETORING RM6 solution needs only about 8mm flange spread. In the same moment it is capable to compensate axial and radial differential expansions and fully resistant to thermal and pressure shocks just in the same way that other classic ‘omega’ lip weld-ring gaskets can do.Such special RM-6 concept solves following problems:total dimensional chain of equipment / installation remains nearly the same,effectively no longer bolts are needed after putting RM-6 instead of previous flat gasket solution.Our production is just in progress with RM6 Weld Ring from alloy 800 forecasted for High Temp application.Another example of customized Special Metal Seals from #SPETECH to heavy chemistry💪Watch a short movie and find out why to use SPETORING®RM Weld Ring Gaskets instead of flat ones👇https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbjsi2uZcmQSpetech® 360˚Spetech® Laminated Triple Offset Butterfly Valve SealSpetech® Weld Ring GasketSpetech® Double Cone SealSpetech® Dryflex® Super Flexible KammprofileSpetech® Carrier RingSpetech General PresentationSpetech® 360˚Spetech® Laminated Triple Offset Butterfly Valve SealSpetech® Weld Ring GasketSpetech® Double Cone SealSpetech® Dryflex® Super Flexible KammprofileSpetech® Carrier RingSpetech General Presentation

But standard Weld Ring Gasket require about 30 to 50mm gap between spread flanges to be installed which sometimes might be an issue.A common question from people willing to put Weld Ring Seal is “can this 30 or 50mm spread be somehow reduced”, as sometimes large flange spread distance is not available.The answer is ‘YES, the spread can be reduced’ and the solution you can find on presented RM4 / RM5 / RM6 Weld Rings height and flange spread gap comparation.This particular SPETORING RM6 solution needs only about 8mm flange spread. In the same moment it is capable to compensate axial and radial differential expansions and fully resistant to thermal and pressure shocks just in the same way that other classic ‘omega’ lip weld-ring gaskets can do.Such special RM-6 concept solves following problems:total dimensional chain of equipment / installation remains nearly the same,effectively no longer bolts are needed after putting RM-6 instead of previous flat gasket solution.Our production is just in progress with RM6 Weld Ring from alloy 800 forecasted for High Temp application.Another example of customized Special Metal Seals from #SPETECH to heavy chemistry💪Watch a short movie and find out why to use SPETORING®RM Weld Ring Gaskets instead of flat ones👇https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbjsi2uZcmQSpetech® 360˚Spetech® Laminated Triple Offset Butterfly Valve SealSpetech® Weld Ring GasketSpetech® Double Cone SealSpetech® Dryflex® Super Flexible KammprofileSpetech® Carrier RingSpetech General PresentationSpetech® 360˚Spetech® Laminated Triple Offset Butterfly Valve SealSpetech® Weld Ring GasketSpetech® Double Cone SealSpetech® Dryflex® Super Flexible KammprofileSpetech® Carrier RingSpetech General Presentation
